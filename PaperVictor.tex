\begin{abstract}
Porous silicon (PS) is a very versatile material for developing optical
devices based on multilayered structures, since high and low porosity layers
can be synthesized by a simple electrochemical technique. In the present work, the
average reflectance $\braket{R}$ \notaL{No entiendo por qué insisten
  en no usar tipografía matemática para símbolos como $R$. Los
  símbolos de menor y mayor no corresponden a los de promediar.}. of PS-based mirrors is maximized within a wide
wavelength and angular range for different porosity contrasts. Optimization is
performed to maximize the reflectance for minimum  thickness of the structure in the
visible (Vis) and near infrarred (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.   The
mirrors are designed \notaL{No entiendo para qué haber cambiado el
  modo de activo a pasivo; es mucho mejor el activo.} using \textit{chirped}-type structures and \textit{stacking}
sub-mirrors. The chirped structures are found to be more suitable for the Vis range,
while stacked sub-mirrors are found to be better for the NIR region. Design, fabrication
and testing of some optimized omnidirectional structures with less
than 100 pairs of layers \notaL{Quizás periods no sea correcto, pues

been demonstrated.

\section{Introduction}

Photonic crystal (PC)-based structures have been extensively investigated due
to their light controlling properties \cite{Joannopoulos2008,Goyal2018}.
Photons entering a PC interact with its periodically varying dielectric constant and
are consequently organized into photonic bands. Analogous to electrons in a
crystal, their propagation is forbidden if their energy lies
within certain regions known as photonic band gaps (PBG's). Thus, the
PC behaves as a mirror if illuminated by light with frequencies
within in a PBG. For several applications it is useful to fabricate
{\em ommnidirectional} mirrors with a wide band gap.  The use of metallic
mirrors is limited due to their relatively large absorption at
visible and near infrared frequencies.  An attractive alternative
consists of low-absorption dielectric
structures,  which may be designed for specific frequency
ranges. One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) PCs have
applications in optoelectronics, optical telecommunications and computing,
laser technology \cite{Lopez2003,Masaya2010}, and radiative cooling applications
\cite{Kumar2020}. The simplest 1D-PC is composed of a finite number
of periodically alternating
layers of high $n_{H}$ and low $n_{L}$ refractive indices, with
corresponding thicknesses $d_H$ and $d_L$ chosen so that their optical
thicknesses corresponds to a quarter of a wavelength
$n_{H}d_{H}=n_{L}d_{L}=\lambda_{0}/4$ at a nominal
wavelength $\lambda_{0}$. This yields a {\em Bragg mirror} (BM)
which might have a large PBG including an omnidirectional gap if the contrast $n_H/n_L$
and the number of periods are large enough. Mirrors with high
reflectance within a wider frequency range may be engineered by
using different nominal wavelengths for different layers.
One way to obtain such structures is to gradually change the width of
the layers as a function of their depth, producing
\textit{chirped}-type structures \cite{Zipock1997}.
Another alternative is to stack BMs, in such a way that their reflection bands partially
overlap each other at their edges, resulting in a wider high-reflection band \cite{Xifre2009}.

On the other hand, different fabrication techniques have been used to
obtain omnidirectional (OD) mirrors that operate on the visible and/or
near infrared (Vis-NIR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. For
example, Chen et al. \cite{Chen1999},
reported the fabrication of a
6-pair TiO$_{2}$/SiO$_{2}$ structure with
an OD band of about 70 nm in the NIR range, employing sol-gel deposition
method. Park et al. \cite{Park2003}, used molecular beam epitaxy to
grow a stack of four pairs of GaAs/AlAs layers, followed by its conversion to
GaAs/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ layers by selective oxidation of the AlAs
layers, to obtain an OD with a band from 710 to 950 nm.
On the other hand, DeCorby et al. \cite{DeCorby2005}, fabricated mirrors by
coupling multiple layers of Ge$_{33}$As$_{12}$Se$_{55}$ chalcogenide glass and
polyamide-imide polymer, deposited by thermal evaporation and spin-casting
respectively, to obtain a 150 nm wide omnidirectional band centered at
1750 nm. Furthermore, Jena et al. \cite{Jena2019},
used sequential asymmetric bipolar pulsed DC magnetron sputtering (for TiO$%
_{2}$ layers) and radio frequency magnetron sputtering (for SiO$_{2}$
layers) to generate TiO$_{2}$/SiO$_{2}$ 1D-PC's and achieved an OD band from
592 to 668 nm. However, these techniques are expensive and they
require sophisticated equipment and long fabrication times. Using PS
is an attractive alternative, since it can be easily manufactured by
electrochemical etching crystalline Si in an hydrofluoric
acid based electrolyte, to obtain a sponge-like nanostructure composed
of Si and air. By modulating the supplied current and its application
time during the electrochemical reaction, it is possible to obtain
multilayered structures allowing for the fabrication OD mirrors \cite{Xifre2015,Pavesi2000}.
Although optical filters \cite{Estevez2009,Ariza2014} are the most common
application of PS PC's, they have also been widely used as chemical
sensors \cite{Giusseppe2011,Agarwal2018}, waveguides \cite{Hussel1997} and
for photoluminescence control \cite{Antunez2014}. Recently, the study of
chirped multilayer structures has
increased due to their possible application as flat focusing mirrors \cite{Wu2021,Kozar2017,Cheng2018}.
PS based dielectric optical filters, quasi-OD and OD mirrors have been extensively studied in different
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the ultraviolet (UV)
\cite{Jimenez2020}, visible \cite{Ariza2012}, and NIR \cite{Bruyant2003} region.
However, to obtain the desirable high index of refraction
contrast, layers of high porosity have to be employed, which makes the
resulting structures relatively fragile. In addition, use of high porosity makes the fabrication of large structures, with a
very large number of layers, unfeasible. For this reason, in this work
we study different strategies to produce multilayered mirrors
with high reflectance omnidirectional band
with relatively small thickness and refractive index contrast.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \ref{s:theory} we develop the
methods used to design and calculate the reflectance spectra of the PS
multilayered structures such as chirped structures and mirror
stacks. In Sec. \ref{s:exp} we provide details about the
fabrication of these structures. In Sec. \ref{s:res} we present the numerical
and experimental results corresponding to our proposed structures and compare
them to previous reports. We obtained significantly large band-widths
with relatively thinner structures than reported before.
Finally, we discuss our conclusions in Section \ref{s:conc}.

%\section{Numerical simulation} \label{s:theory}
\section{Theory} \label{s:theory}
\notaV{Nombre de la sección propuesta por Dr. David}
\notaL{Estoy en desacuerdo con el título Numerical simulations. Un
  cálculo no es en general una simulación.}
\notaV{Parrafos reescritos por Dr. David}
\notaL{¿Por qué reescribir toda la teoría? ¿Por qué dar tanta teoría?}

We develop two techniques to design
multilayer photonic structures. In the first, the wavelength
($\lambda _{j}$) to which the $j$-th pair of layers is tuned is modulated by
a given function of $j$. Several functions are proposed and their
parameters are optimized to maximize the $\braket{R}$ averaged over
wavelength and angle over a suitable range.
To that end we employed the Minuit module of the Perl Data Language (PDL) \cite{minuit}.
The other technique we employed consisted in stacking
sub-mirrors tuned to different wavelengths, chosen so that their
spectral ranges overlap. For each submirror, the spectral range was
obtained from the dispersion relation of a corresponding periodic
structure.

For the analysis of the propagation of electromagnetic fields
through multilayer systems, we employ a variant of the transfer matrix
method based on the formalism of Puente-Díaz et al. \cite{Puente2020}.
Its advantage over other formally equivalent approaches
\cite{Mochan1987,Ortiz2020,Chavez2020} is that it allows a
numerically stable
calculation of the reflectance even of very large multilayer systems,
even in the presence of absorption.
We assume  the system has  variations only along the $z$ direction
and consider an incident linearly polarized beam of light
(either TE or TM polarization) that propagates throughout
the structure. The reflectance and transmittance are given by
$R=|r|^{2}$ and  $T=\beta \left\vert t\right\vert ^{2}$,
respectively, with \cite{Puente2020}
\begin{equation}
	r=\sigma \frac{Z_{0}M_{11}+M_{12}-Z_{0}Z_{s}M_{21}-Z_s
		M_{22}}{Z_{0}M_{11}-M_{12}-Z_{0}Z_{s}M_{21}+Z_{s}M_{22}},  \label{rBloch}
\end{equation}%
and
\begin{equation}
	t=\frac{2\zeta}{Z_{0}M_{11}-M_{12}-Z_{0}Z_{s}M_{21}+Z_{s}M_{22}},  \label{tBloch}
\end{equation}%
where $Z_0$ and $Z_s$ are the surface impedances of vacuum
and substrate, respectively, $\beta =\text{Re}Z_{0}/\text{Re}Z_{s}$,
$\sigma=-1$ and
$\zeta =Z_s$ for
TE polarization, while $\beta=\text{Re}Z_{s}/
\text{Re}Z_{0}$, $\sigma=+1$, and $\zeta =Z_0$ for TM
polarization.
Here, $M_{ij}$ are the elements
of the reconstructed transfer matrix
\begin{equation}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{$\displaystyle{
	M=\frac{1}{Z^{+}-Z^{-}} \left(
	\begin{array}{cc}

	\end{array}%
	\right) \text{.}}$}
\label{MsBloch}
\end{equation}
which relates the electromagnetic fields at the substrate to those at
the surface,
Here, $Z^{\pm }$ are the surface impedances of the multilayered system
for fields propagating toward the substrate ($+$) or towards vacuum
($-$), and are given by
\begin{equation}
	Z^{\pm }=-\frac{\widetilde{M}_{12}}{\widetilde{M}_{11}-\Lambda _{\pm }}\text{,}  \label{ZBloch}
\end{equation}%
where
\begin{equation}
	\Lambda _{-}=\frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\,\widetilde{M}\pm
        i\sqrt{1-\left( \text{Tr}\,\widetilde{M}/2\right)
		^{2}}\text{,}  \label{LBloch}
\end{equation}%
is chosen to satisfy the inequality $\left\vert \Lambda
_{-}\right\vert >1$, and $\Lambda _{+}=1/\Lambda _{-}$, and Tr denotes
the trace. $\widetilde{M}$ denotes the usual transfer matrix
\begin{equation}
	\widetilde{M} = \prod \limits_{j=1}^{N}%
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos k_{j}d_{j} & iZ_{j}\sin k_{j}d_{j} \\
		iY_{j}\sin k_{j}d_{j} & \cos k_{j}d_{j}%
	\end{pmatrix}%
	\label{Mcoef}
\end{equation}%
of the multilayered system, where
\begin{equation}
	k_{j}=\sqrt{\epsilon _{j}q^{2}-Q^{2}}  \label{kj}
\end{equation}%
is the normal component of the wave vector whithin the $j$-th layer, $Z_{j}$ is
its surface impedance, $Y_{j}=1/Z_{j}$ its surface
admittance, $\epsilon _{j}=n_{j}^{2}$ its permitivity (for simplicity we
assumed all media were nonmagnetic, with permeability $\mu _{i}=1$),
$q=\omega /c=2\pi /\lambda $ is the free-space wavenumber corresponding to
the wavelength $\lambda $ and
\begin{equation}
	Q=n_{0}q\sin \theta _{i}  \label{Snell}
\end{equation}%
is the projection of wavevector onto the interfaces,
which is conserved according to Snell's law, with
$\theta _{i}$ the angle of incidence. The surface
impedances are given by $Z_{j}=q/k_{j}$ for TE
polarization and $Z_{j}=k_{j}/q\epsilon _{j}$ for
TM polarization. The complex refractive index of the porous layers were
obtained through the Bruggeman's effective medium
theory, which has been reported to adequately reproduce
the PS optical parameters \cite{Giusseppe2011,Pap2006,Estrada2018}.

\section{Experimental details}\label{s:exp}


Some of the proposed photonic structures were synthesized through anodic
etching of a (100) oriented, $p$-type Boron doped, crystalline Si wafer with
resistivity 0.002-0.005 $\Omega \cdot $cm, under galvanostatic conditions
\cite{Canham1990,Escorcia2007}. The electrochemical anodization process was
performed at room temperature, with an electrolyte of aqueous
hydrofluoric acid (HF) (48$\%$ of
wt) and ethanol (99.9$\%$ of wt) in 1:1 volumetric proportion, respectively.
However, as it is not desirable to use very high
porosity contrasts due to structure fragility and electrolyte
diffusivity problems \cite{Ariza2011}, the current
densities were chosen as 35 and 305 $\text{mA}/\text{cm}^{2}$,
with corresponding porosities of 51\% and 76\%, respectively.
These porosities were obtained through previously obtained calibration
curves using a gravimetric technique \cite{Pap2006}. The
etching rate of PS was obtained by synthetizing single layers under
similar conditions and measuring their thicknesses through Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM). Absolute reflectivity measurements were
carried out with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/Visible
spectrophotometer with a variable angle universal reflectance
accessory (URA) for different incident angles $\theta _{i}=10^{\circ
}$, $20^{\circ }$, $30^{\circ }$, $40^{\circ }$, $50^{\circ }$ and
$60^{\circ }$ using non-polarized light. The maximum and minimum
values of $\theta _{i}$ were constrained by the angular range of the
equipment accessory URA.


\section{Results and discussion}\label{s:res}


In this section we present optimized calculations of the reflectance
of different multilayered omnidirectional wide-band mirrors and we
compare the results with experimental spectra taken from
the corresponding samples at several angles of
incidence. Sec. \ref{ss:chirped} is devoted to chirped-type Bragg
mirrors while Sec. \ref{ss:stacked} is devoted to structures made of
stacked sub-mirrors.

\notaL{Aquí quitaron un comentario mío. ¿Ya no es relevante? ¿Ya se
  explicó cómo se hizo el diseño?}
\subsection{Chirped-type Bragg mirrors}\label{ss:chirped}


Here we study multilayered structures where the thicknesses for each
pair $j=0\ldots N_p-1$ of layers are tuned to a wavelength $\lambda_j$ which changes
gradually with the depth of the layer, according to
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{j}=\lambda_{\min }+\left(\lambda_{\max }-\lambda_{\min}\right) f\left(\frac{j}{N_p-1}\right),\label{Dis}
\end{equation}%
where $\lambda_{\min }$ and $\lambda_{\max }$ are the minimum and
maximum {\em design} wavelengths respectively, $N_p$ is the number of
periods  in the structure and $f(\xi)$ is some smooth function that
goes from 0 to 1 as its argument goes from surface ($\xi=0$) to the
substrate ($\xi=1)$. We only consider increasing functions $f$ due to
the high absorption of PS in the ultraviolet region which decreases in
the visible and becomes negligible in the near infrared, so, the first
periods are tuned in the UV-Vis regions. We consider the
following classes of functions:
\begin{equation}
f_{1}\left(\xi \right) =\xi^{\alpha },  \label{F1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{2}\left(\xi \right) =\frac{1}{2}\left(\xi^{\alpha }+\xi^{\beta}\right)
\label{F2}
\end{equation}
and%
\begin{equation}
f_{3}\left(\xi\right) =Ax^{\alpha }\left(1-\xi\right) +\xi^{\beta },  \label{F3}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $A$ are parameters to optimize
to maximize the average reflectance $\braket{R}$. The function
$f_{1}$ (Eq. (\ref {F1})) represents simple increasing profiles,
restricting  $\alpha>0$. The function $f_2$ is an arithmetic average
of two functions of the type $f_{1}$ with different
powers $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The function $f_{3}$ (Eq. (\ref{F3})) is
designed so that the first term dominates near the surface and the
second near the substrate, to allow different behaviors
at the edges of the spectrum.
The parameters
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $A$ and $N_{p}$ were optimized to maximize $\braket{R}$. The reflectance $R(\lambda,
\theta)$ was calculated for non-polarized light in two regions of
the electromagnetic spectrum. The first region, $\mathcal R_1$,  was chosen from 350 to
1400 nm and second one $\mathcal R_2$ was selected from 400 to 3000 nm, both in the
angular range of $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. For $\mathcal R_1$ we took
$\lambda_{\min}$ as a parameter to be optimized while $\lambda_{\max}$
was fixed at 1400 nm. For $\mathcal R_2$ we fixed both $\lambda_{\min}=850$nm and $\lambda_{\min}=3000$nm. The
calculations were carried out using the Perl Data Language (PDL) and
its interface with the MINUIT \cite{minuit} minimization package. The
optimized parameters corresponding to low and high porosities $p_l=0.51$ and $p_h=0.76$
are shown in Table \ref{tab:tableA}.

The function
$f_{3}$ yields after optimization the highest $\braket{R}$ in the
region $\mathcal R_1$ with the thinnest structure (see table
\ref{tab:tableA}). Furthermore, this structure has a calculated OD gap
\notaL{I'm unsure about the nomenclature ``gap''. I guess it is
  theoretical, right?}
of 250 nm centered at 1125 nm with a
reflectance
$R>0.90$, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig1}(b). We
synthesized a structure  designated {\em sample $S_1$} corresponding
to these results. For the region $\mathcal R_2$ the
resulting structures have similar thicknesses and attain similar reflectance
spectra, though the one with the smallest thickness and the maximum
reflectance is that obtained from the family $f_{1}$. We
also synthesized the corresponding
structure and designated it {\em sample $S_2$}. The
calculated optimized reflectance spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig1}(d).
This structure has a very wide region where $ R(\lambda, \theta)>
0.90$, which goes from 850 to 3000 nm in an angular range
from $0^\circ$ to $70^\circ$. Thus, it has a
quasi-OD (q-OD) gap of 2150 nm centered at 1925 nm.
The functions $f_i$ optimized for the region $\mathcal R_1$ are shown
in Fig. \ref{Fig1}(a), and those for $\mathcal R_2$
in Fig. \ref{Fig1}(c). The profiles $f_i$ are qualitatively
similar. For example, for $\mathcal R_1$ the optimal photonic
structures have a small number of periods tuned to the wavelengths where
silicon has a large absorption, i.e.,  the first periods of the
structure. For $\mathcal R_2$ it is only necessary that the periods
have an adequate ordering. \notaL{No entendí qué hay que comentar en

\end{figure}

We measured the reflectance spectra of samples $S_1$ and $S_2$
at various angles of incidence $\theta$. Due to
experimental limitations, we restrict our results to the case of
unpolarized light. In Fig. \ref{Fig2}(a), the calculated and measured
reflectance corresponding to sample $S_1$ are compared from 350 to 1400 nm for different angles of
incidence ($\theta=10^\circ$, $20^\circ$, $30^\circ$, $40^\circ$,
$50^\circ$, and $60^\circ$). The spectra are qualitatively similar,
and for $\lambda>700$ nm and
$10^\circ < \theta < 40^\circ$, they agree quantitatively, with a
difference smaller than $5\%$. \notaL{Yo no veo nada especial en 40 grados: and for
$\theta > 40^\circ$ both spectra are qualitatively consistent}  The
measured reflectance is lower than the calculated one, more so at
small wavelengths and large angles. This difference
may be partially attributed to the scattering of light due to the
roughness present at the sample
\cite{Theiss1994,Chavez2020,Ortiz2020} that we have not taken into
account in our theory. Due to the limitations of our
spectrophotometer, we couldn't perform measurements for $\theta>60^\circ$ and thus
check the OD gap. Nevertheless, our results allow us to conclude that
the structure has a quasi-omni-directional
bandgap (R$\left(\lambda,\theta \right)>0.90$) between 980 and
1340 nm.

        (panel a)  and $S_2$ (panel b). The gray band indicates the
        region where the reflectance is greater than  $0.90$,
        corresponding to the quasi OD gap of the

\end{figure}
In Fig. \ref{Fig2}(b) we compare the
calculated and measured spectra of sample $S_2$ in the range
from 400 to 3000 nm.
Both spectra are very similar, with some differences at long
wavelengths which can be
attributed to an increase of imperfections such as wavy layers and
more roughness for deeper layers, due to a more restricted diffusivity
of the electrolyte as the thickness of the structure is increased
\cite{Negro2003,Vincent1993}. According to our results, this
structure has a wide quasi-omnidirectional gap ($R>0.90$) of 1800 nm
centered at 1880 nm.



\subsection{Photonic structure with sub-mirrors stacking}\label{ss:stacked}

Another class of techniques for designing good reflectors across a wide spectral range
is to stack sub-mirrors tuned to different wavelengths chosen with
different criteria. For
example, Agarwal et al. \cite{Agarwal2003} proposed to stack sub-mirrors as follows:
tune the first sub-mirror to certain wavelength $\lambda_{1}$. Tune
subsequent submirrors $j$ to wavelengths $\lambda_j$, chosen so that $\lambda_{j+1} +
\lambda_{j}=2+j$ \notaL{This cannot be correct. Please check}. Furthermore, Estrada-Wiese et al. \cite{DelRio2018}
developed a method that combines three stochastic optimization algorithms together with
a  narrow space search methodology to obtain a customized and optimized
PC configuration.

We recall that for a periodic structure, the propagation of
electromagnetic waves is described by the dispersion relation
\begin{equation}
	 \cos (KD) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \bm M,   \label{Dispersion}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is Bloch's vector, $\bm M$ the transfer matrix of a single
period of thickness $D$ \cite{Mochan1987, Mochan1988,
  Perez2018}. \notaL{Tr was already defined and the reference to the
  equation is wrong:  denotes the trace
and $M$ is the matrix given by Eq. \ref{MsBloch}}. Thus,
whenever $\left\vert\text {Tr} \left(M \right) \right\vert>2$
electromagnetic energy cannot propagate in the periodic system and we
expect a high reflectance for a finite system made of a finite number
of periods. This suggests the following design. We stack submirrors
each made of a few periods of a periodic system such that its photonic band gap
(PBG) overlaps the PBG of the previous and that of the next
submirror. The number of periods of each sub-mirror is an
important parameter. If it is too small, the sub-mirror would be
partially transparent within the PBG. If it is too large, the
resulting structure would be too thick. We followed two design
strategies: In the first, we considered sub-mirrors each with the same
number of periods. In the second, a different number of periods was
assigned to each submirrors with a PBG center within different
spectral regions: we used a single period for
$\lambda_{D}<500$ nm, two periods for $500 <\lambda_ {D} < 650$ nm
and three periods for $650<\lambda_ {D}<800$ nm.  and for
$\lambda_{D}>800$ nm, the number of periods was variable.\notaL{No se
  entiende. Los números uno, dos, tres ¿se sacaron de la manga? ¿se
  optimizaron? Para <800, ¿de dónde se sacó el número de periodos?}
In both
designs, the optimal overlap of two consecutive PBGs was obtained that
maximized reflectance.\notaL{No quisiste decir average reflectance
  $\braket{R}$?. Si sí, en qué rango promediaste?}
Reflectance spectra were calculated for
$400\text{nm}\le \lambda\le 3000\text{nm}$ and for $0^\circ\le\theta\le90^\circ$.

Table \ref{tab:table2} shows the number of periods of each sub-mirror
($Np_{se}$),\notaL{Está difícil esta notación. ¿De dónde vienen la s y
  la e. $Np_{se}$ parece el producto de $N$ con $p_{se}$. ¿De dónde la
  p?} the total number of stacked sub mirrors ($N_{se}$)
\notaL{El encabezado de la tabla está mal}, the
thickness of the structure, the optimal overlap of two consecutive
PBGs and the average reflectance. The first block corresponds to
sub-mirrors with a constant number of periods, while the second block
corresponds to sub-mirrors with a variable number of periods according
to the design wavelength.\notaL{No entiendo nada: qué dejaste fijo y
  qué permitiste variar para optimizar en cada bloque de la tabla?}

According to table \ref{tab:table2}, the structure that has the highest
reflectance is in the second block, with an optimal overlap between
consecutive PBGs of $78\%$, a thickness of
41.5 $\mu$m, and  average reflectance $\braket{0.953}$. It is made up
of 18 sub-mirrors tuned to the following wavelengths
400, 460, 510, 570, 640, 720,810,910, 1020, 1150, 1290, 1450, 1630,
1830, 2060, 2320, 2610, and 2860 nm.
We synthesized this structure and designated it {\em sample $S_3$}.
Its calculated and measured
reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. \ref{Fig3}.

Fig. \ref{Fig3}(a) reveals a quasi omnidirectional
mirror in the range from 950 to 2900 nm, with an angular range between $0^\circ$ and
$60^\circ$. It is also observed that at incidence angles $\theta
>70^\circ$ and long
wavelengths the reflectance decreases and has oscillations, which are attributed to the
greater penetration of the electromagnetic field within the structure, as shown by
Puente-D\'{\i}az, et al. \cite{Puente2020}. In Fig. \ref{Fig3}(b) we compare the
calculated and measured reflectance for the structure $S_3$ at several angles of
incidence. Although, the quasi omnidirectional wavelength range of the synthesized
structure is slightly smaller than the calculated one, from 950 to 2750 nm, the measured
PBG is almost twice as wide as a recently reported PS chirped
structure \cite{Chavez2020}. \notaL{Por qué comparamos con ésta? ¿Era
  la mejor que había? Habría que decirlo}

Finally, Table \ref{tab:table3} shows some porous silicon based OD mirrors designed to operate in the NIR
region and the width of the omnidirectional band gaps are compared
with those of the structures
analyzed in the present study. The table reveals that the porous silicon based
structures $S_2$ and $S_3$ have the widest gap widths, 1.36 times greater than the
largest reported work until now in the NIR region \cite{Wu2021}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{s:conc}

We have designed, fabricated and characterized highly reflective quasi
omnidirectional (angular range of $0-60^\circ$) multilayered structures with a wide
spectral range, optimized through two techniques: chirping and
stacking of Bragg-type sub-structures. Numerical calculations were
carried out employing the transfer matrix method and we optimized the
design parameters to maximize the average reflectance of the
structures. We manufactured some of the optimized structures with
porous silicon
dielectric multilayers and compared their measured  optical properties
to the results of calculations. For the
chirping method, a couple of structures were fabricated, one with
a thicknesses of 21.6 $\mu$m and another with a thickness of 60.4 $\mu$m,
resulting in reflectivity q-OD bandwidthso of 360nm and 1800nm centered
at 1160nm and 1925nm, respectively. For the stacked sub-structures
method we obtained a 41.5$\mu$m thickness mirror with a q-OD
bandwidth of
1800nm centered at 1850nm. Therefore, the second technique is found
to be better as it results in thiner structures with a noticeable
improvement in the average
reflectance. Additionally, the analysis techniques developed here can
be used to optimize the reflectance for other refractive index contrasts
in PS multilayers or in different systems with other types of
materials. Such proposed structures could be used as mirrors for solar
concentrators, flat focusing reflectors, thermal regulators, or, if
defects are included, as filters or remote chemical/biosensors with a
wide angular independent response.
