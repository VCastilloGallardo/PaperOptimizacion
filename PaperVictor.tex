\begin{abstract}
Porous silicon (PS) is a very versatile material for developing optical
devices based on multilayer structures, since high and low porosity layers
can be synthesized by simple electrochemical technique. We report the
maximization of average reflectance (R$_{\text{prom}}\left(\lambda,\theta%
\right)$) with minimum possible thickness of PS-based mirrors with different
porosity contrasts. Optimization is performed in two regions (Visible and
NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We employ two techniques to design the
mirrors: \textit{chirped} structures and the \textit{stacking} of sub-mirrors. The
chirped structures were found to be relatively more suitable for obtaining
highly reflectivity in the visible range, while the second type of
structure was more effective for obtaining high reflectivity in the IR
region. Some of the optimized omnidirectional structures with less than 100
periods have been designed and experimentally demonstrated in a wide
spectral range.

\section{Introduction}

Photonic crystal (PC)-based structures are extensively investigated due
to their light controlling properties \cite{Joannopoulos2008,Goyal2018}.
Photons entering a PC interact with its periodically varying dielectric constant and 
are consequently organized into photonic bands. Analogous to electrons in a
crystal, their propagation will be limited by photonic band gaps (PBGs)
where transmission states are forbidden. The PC  shows a 
PBG corresponding to the electromagnetic modes which are not allowed to propagate
through the structure and behaves as a perfect mirror for that range. The width of
reflection spectrum is important while designing an omnidirectional mirror for 
different applications. The metallic mirrors are widely accepted for reflection 
purposes, but widespread use is limited due to their absorptive nature at the 
visible and near infrared frequencies.  A good alternative are dielectric
structures as they also provide design flexibility in terms of
reflection wavelength. These properties are widely used to design various
one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) PCs for its
potential applications in optoelectronics, optical telecommunications and computing, 
laser technology \cite{Lopez2013,Masaya2010}, and radiative cooling applications 
\cite{Kumar2020}. The simplest 1D PC is composed of alternating high $\left( 
n_{H}\right) $ and low $\left(n_{L}\right) $ refractive index layers (Bragg Mirror, 
BM). The optical thicknesses are typically chosen to be quarter-wavelength length, $
n_{H}d_{H}=n_{L}d_{L}=\lambda _{0}/4$, at some operating wavelength $\lambda
_{0}$ (center wavelength) to obtain a certain
omnidirectional band gap. As the gap depends on the contrast of the
refractive indices and the number of periods,  broadband mirrors can  be
engineered by modulating the reflection in a broader wavelength range.
One of the ways to obtain such structures has been the continuous variation of 
thicknesses along the depth, defined as \textit{chirped}-type \cite{Zipock1997} 
structures. Additionally, broader mirrors can also be achieved by overlapping 
different BMs, where each one reflects around a specific central wavelength, 
resulting in a wider photonic band gap \cite{Xifre2009}.

Till now, different deposition techniques have been used to obtain omnidirectional 
BM (ODBM) that operate on the visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) range of the
electromagnetic spectrum. For example, Chen et al., \cite{Chen1999} have
reported an ODBM of about 70 nm in NIR range designed with 6-pairs  of 
TiO$_{2}$/SiO$_{2}$ deposited using sol-gel method. Park et al., \cite{Park2003} 
used molecular beam epitaxy to grow a stack of four pairs of GaAs$/$AlAs layers, 
followed by its conversion to a multilayer stack of GaAs/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ by selective
oxidation of the AlAs layers, to obtain an ODBM with a gap from 710 to 950
nm. On the other hand, DeCorby et al., \cite{DeCorby2005} fabricated mirrors by 
coupling multiple layers of Ge$_{33}$As$_{12}$Se$_{55}$ chalcogenide glass and
polyamide-imide polymer, deposited by thermal evaporation and spin-casting 
respectively, to obtain 150 nm wide omnidirectional band, centered at 1750 nm 
wavelength. Furthermore, Jena et al., \cite{Jena2016}
used sequential asymmetric bipolar pulsed DC magnetron sputtering (for TiO$%
_{2}$ layers) and radio frequency magnetron sputtering (for SiO$_{2}$
layers) to generate 1DPC of TiO$_{2}$/SiO$_{2}$ and achieved ODBM from
592 to 668 nm. However, these techniques are expensive and
require sophisticated equipment and long fabrication time. Using porous silicon (PS) 
is an alternative, as PS is typically fabricated by simple electrochemical etching of
crystalline Si in hydrofluoric acid based electrolyte, to obtain the
sponge-like nanostructure composed of Si and air in a relatively short duration of 
time. The generated porosity can be tuned by changing the applied current
density and hence modifies the refractive index of the resulting PS. This
fact opens the possibility of designing 1DPC with PS, which seeks to
control the propagation of light in a dielectric medium. The low cost and
ease of obtaining porous silicon make it an excellent candidate to develop
optical devices based on multilayer structures \cite{Xifre2015,Pavesi2000}.
Although optical filters \cite{Estevez2009,Ariza2014} are the most common
application of porous silicon, they have been widely used as chemical
sensors \cite{Giusseppe2011,Agarwal2018}, waveguides \cite{Hussel1997} and
photoluminescence control \cite{Antunez2014}. Recently, the study of 
quasi-omnidirectional Bragg mirrors has increased due to their possible application 
as a flat lens \cite{Kozar2017,Cheng2018}. In particular, PS based dielectric 
optical filters, quasi-ODBM and ODBM have been extensively studied in different 
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet (UV) 
\cite{Jimenez2020}, visible \cite{Ariza2012}, and (NIR) \cite{Bruyant2003}. Keeping 
in view that high values of average porosity, refractive index contrast and 
thickness make the multilayer structures fragile, in this work various wide
band gap photonic structures have been proposed to obtain maximal average 
reflectance (R$_{\text{ave}}\left( \lambda ,\theta \right) $) with the minimum 
possible thickness and low refractive index contrast.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the development of
methods used to design and calculate the reflectance spectra of the PS
multilayer structures. Section 3 provides the experimental details about the
fabrication of some of these structures. Section 4 presents the numerical
results corresponding to different methodologies (chirped structures and sub-mirror stacks) adopted to minimize the thickness of the structure for 
maximal reflectance along with the experimental results and its comparison with the 
existing reports.  The obtained experimental results revealed an enhancement in the 
quasi omnidirectional band gap (0-60${{}^\circ}$) by a factor of approximately 2 
with half the structure physical thickness in both the configurations, compared to 
the last reported works \cite{DelRio2018,Chavez2020}. Finally, the conclusions of 
this work are presented in Section 5.

\section{Theoretical analysis}

In the analysis of the propagation of the electromagnetic field through
multilayer systems, it is common to employ the transfer matrix method (put the 
reference). Under the consideration that the system only varies along the $z$ axis, the transfer matrix is $M\left(z_{2},z_{1}\right)$ 
a 2x2 matrix that relates the components of the electric field E$_{\parallel }$
and the magnetic field H$_{\parallel }$ parallel to the $xy$ plane, and
normal to the axis of the structure, evaluated at any two points $z_{2}$
and $z_{1}$
\begin{equation*}
\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
E_{\Vert } \\ 
H_{\Vert }%
\end{array}%
\right) _{z_{2}}=M\left( z_{2},z_{1}\right) \left( 
\begin{array}{c}
E_{\Vert } \\ 
H_{\Vert }%
\end{array}%
\right) _{z_{1}}.
\end{equation*}%
Many equivalent formulations have been proposed to obtain $M$ \cite%
{Mochan1987,Ortiz2020,Chavez2020}. Here we use a recently developed formalism  
to calculate the reflectance of large multilayer systems proposed by Puente-D%
\'{\i}az, et al \cite{Puente2020}, since we need a reliable and stable tool
to design an optimized structure through a minimization procedure that
requires the calculation of complete spectra for all sets of design parameters. 
The development of $M$ is shown in the supplementary information. Therefore, the 
explicit expressions for the optical coefficients are: 
\begin{equation}
r=\mp \frac{Z_{0}\tilde{M}_{11}+\tilde{M}_{12}-Z_{0}Z_{s}\tilde{M}_{21}-Z_{s}%
\tilde{M}_{22}}{Z_{0}\tilde{M}_{11}-\tilde{M}_{12}-Z_{0}Z_{s}\tilde{M}%
_{21}+Z_{s}\tilde{M}_{22}},  \label{rBloch}
\end{equation}%
and 
\begin{equation}
t=\frac{2Z_{\alpha }}{Z_{0}\tilde{M}_{11}-\tilde{M}_{12}-Z_{0}Z_{s}\tilde{M}%
_{21}+Z_{s}\tilde{M}_{22}},  \label{tBloch}
\end{equation}%
where the upper sign $-$ in Eq. (\ref{rBloch}) and the subscript $\alpha =s$
in Eq. (\ref{tBloch}) are chosen for the case of TE polarization, while
the lower sign $+$ and the subscript $\alpha =0$ correspond to TM
polarization, respectively. Furthermore, $\tilde{M}_{ij}$ are the elements of the transfer matrix. As usual, the reflectance is given by $R=|r|^{2}$ and the
transmittance by $T=\beta \left\vert t\right\vert ^{2}$ with $\beta
=Z_{0}/Z_{s}$ for the case of TE polarization and $\beta =Z_{s}/Z_{0}$ for
the case of TM polarization. Additionally, complex refractive indices of the porous 
layers in the simulations were obtained by Bruggeman effective medium theory, which 
has been reported to adequately reproduce the PS optical parameters 
\cite{Giusseppe2011,Pap2006,Estrada2018}. 

After the next section, two techniques are developed to design multilayer
photonic structures. In the first, the wavelength ($\lambda _{j}$), at which
the $j$-th period of the structure is designed, is modulated by an
increasing function. This can be as simple or complex as you like. The
proposed function was optimized with the Minuit module of PDL (Perl Data
Language) \cite{minuit}. The other technique for proposing highly reflective
structures over a wide region of the electromagnetic spectrum is to stack
sub-mirrors tuned to different wavelengths. For each sub-mirror the
dispersion relation is analyzed.

\section{Experimental details}

Some of the proposed photonic structures were synthesized through anodic
etching of a (100) oriented, p-type Boron doped, crystalline Si wafer with
resistivity 0.002-0.005 $\Omega \cdot $cm, under galvanostatic conditions 
\cite{Canham90,Escorcia07}. Electrochemical anodization process was
performed at room temperature, with an electrolyte of aqueous HF (48$\%$ of
wt) and ethanol (99.9$\%$ of wt) in 1:1 volumetric proportion, respectively.
With this electrolyte, the minimum and maximum porosities that can be
obtained are 35$\%$ and 76$\%$ (gravimetrically obtained), using current densities of 0.5 and 305 mA$/$%
cm$^{2}$, respectively. However, it is not desirable to use very high
porosity contrasts due to structure fragility and electrolyte diffusivity problems \cite{Ariza2011}. 
For this reason, the current
densities were chosen as 35 and 305 mA$/$cm$^{2}$, with corresponding
porosities of 51$\%$ and 76$\%$, respectively. The calibration curves were
acquired through a gravimetric technique as follows: single layers of porous
silicon were synthesized under similar conditions and were weighed ($m_{i}$)
before ($m_{1}$) and after ($m_{2}$) the electrochemical attack, and after
dissolving the already formed porous silicon layer ($m_{3}$), to calculate
the porosity as $p=(m_{1}-m_{2})/(m_{1}-m_{3})$ \cite{Brugeman2006}. Etching
rate of PS was obtained by re-synthetizing individual layers under similar
conditions and measuring their thicknesses through scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The absolute reflectivity measurements were carried out
with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/Visible spectrophotometer with a variable
angle universal reflectance accessory (URA) for different incident angles $%
\theta _{i}=10^{\circ }$, $20^{\circ }$, $30^{\circ }$, $40^{\circ }$, $%
50^{\circ }$ and $60^{\circ }$ using non-polarized light. The maximum and
minimum values of $\theta _{i}$ were constrained by the angular range of the
equipment accessory URA.

\section{Results and discussion}

This section presents the comparison of the calculated and measured reflectance 
spectra at different incidence angles in the regions of interest. In the first 
subsection, the design and optimization of R$_{\text{ave}} 
\left(\lambda,\theta\right)$ of \textit{chirped}  photonic structures is presented, 
and next subsection the design of the structure is analyzed through sub-mirrors 
stacks.

\subsection{Chirped-type Bragg mirrors}

The generic form of the expression that modulates the design of photonic
structure is: 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{j}=\lambda_{\min }+\left(\lambda_{\max }-\lambda_{\min}\right) f\left( x_{j}\right),\label{Dis}
\end{equation}%
where $\lambda _{\min }$, $\lambda _{\max }$ and $\lambda _{j}$ correspond
to the minimum, maximum, and design wavelengths to which the $j$-th period
is tuned, respectively, and $f\left( x_{j}\right) $ represents any
normalized function that modulates the thickness. Here $x_{j}=\frac{j}{N_{p}}$ being 
$j$ the $j$-th period and $N_{p}$ the total number of periods that the structure 
will contain. Only restriction for $f\left( x_{j}\right) $ is that it has to be an 
increasing function, due to the high absorption of PS in the ultraviolet region 
which decreases in the visible and becomes negligible in the near infrared. So, the 
first periods are syntonized in the UV-Vis regions. This work shows the analysis
of following functions:
\begin{equation}
f_{1}\left( x\right) =x^{\alpha },  \label{F1}
\end{equation}%
\begin{equation}
f_{2}\left( x\right) =A\left( x^{\alpha }+x^{\beta}\right)
\label{F2}
\end{equation}%
and%
\begin{equation}
f_{3}\left( x\right) =Ax^{\alpha }\left( 1-x\right) +x^{\beta },  \label{F3}
\end{equation}%
where $\alpha $, $\beta $ and $A$ are parameters to optimize. The function 
$f_{1}$ (Eq. (\ref {F1})) represents the simplest profiles. The restrictions 
for the values $\alpha$ are that they must be positive and they must not be 
extremely large or small. In these cases, mirrors that reflect in $\lambda _{\text{min}}$ or $\lambda _{\text{max}}$,
respectively, will be obtained. Eq. (\ref{F2}) is formed by the average of
two functions of type $f_{1}$ with different powers. The function $f_{3}$
(Eq. (\ref{F3})) was designed so that the first and second additions
predominate the short and long wavelengths, respectively. The R$_{\text{ave}} 
\left(\lambda,\theta\right)$ of the structures is calculated in
the wavelength range from 350 to 1400 nm and from 0 to 90${{}^\circ}$ angle of 
incidence. The optimized parameters using a porosity contrast of $51/76\%$ are shown 
in Table 1 and in the supplementary information they appear for the porosity 
contrasts of $30/76\%$ and $42/76\%$.

\end{table}
  
According to the values shown in table I, the structure (named as ST-A) that has the
maximum average reflectance with the minimum thickness is the one designed
with the function $f_{3}$ (Eq. (\ref{F3})). Thus, the first and last periods
are tuned to 320 and 1400 nm, respectively. The complete distribution of the
periods is presented in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(a).

\label{Fig2}
\end{figure}
To verify that the values
obtained are optimal, in Fig. \ref{Fig2}(b), the average reflectances of the
photonic structures designed with different parameters are mapped and,
indeed, the values are in the area where R$_{\text{ave}}\left( \lambda
,\theta \right)$ is maximum. Here, the parameters $\lambda _{\text{min}}$, 
$\lambda _{\text{max}}$, $\beta$ and $A$ were adjusted, while $N_{p}$ and $\alpha $ 
varied from 30 to 200 periods and from 0.4 to 1.3, respectively. The calculated 
reflectance, R$\left( \lambda ,\theta \right) $, of the photonic structure is shown 
in Fig \ref{Fig2}(c). Here, the wavelength and incidence angle cover the ranges
from 350 to 1400 nm, and from 0${{}^\circ}$ to 90${{}^\circ}$, respectively. 
Calculations indicate that the structure has a localized omnidirectional band gap
from 1000 to 1200 nm, taken with a reflectance greater than 95$\%$. Due to 
experimental limitations, reflectance spectra for non polarized light are shown in all results.
In Fig. \ref{Fig2}(d), the calculated and measured reflectance is compared
at 10${{}^\circ}$, 20${{}^\circ}$, 30${{}^\circ}$, 40${{}^\circ}$, 50${{}^\circ}$ 
and 60${{}^\circ}$ of incidence. In this angular range, the structure has a 
quasi-omnidirectional band gap (R$\left(\lambda,\theta\right)>95\%$) located from 
980 to 1340 nm. The numerical and experimental spectral line shapes at different 
angles are in good agreement. For wavelengths greater than 700 nm and lying between 
10${{}^\circ}$ to 40${{}^\circ}$ of incidence angle, the difference in spectra is 
less than $5\%$. For angles of incidence greater than 40 degree, although their 
characteristics are similar, the measured spectrum demonstrates relatively less 
reflectance than calculated reflectance. This difference can be attributed, in part, 
to the scattering of light between each of the actual interfaces, which generally 
have some roughness \cite{Theiss1994,Chavez2020}.

Due to the absorptive nature of Si in the UV and visible region, it is relatively 
difficult to design porous silicon omnidirectional mirrors in that region.
However, in the IR region, it is relatively easy to obtain highly reflective
and even omnidirectional photonic structures over a wide range. Therefore,
the average reflectance was optimized using the function $f_{1}$ (Eq. (\ref{F1})) 
in the region of 850 to 3000 nm. It was found that the best value for 
$\alpha $ is 1.2 and the minimum thickness is 60.4 $\mu$m, distributed in
90 periods. The complete design of the structure (named as ST-B) is graphed in Fig. 
\ref{Fig3}(a). 
\begin{figure}[tbph]

\caption{(a) Distribution of $\protect\lambda _{j}$ in the $j$-th period

and $N_{p}$ parameters. The optimized parameters are $\protect\alpha =1.2$
and 90 periods. (c) Mapping the calculated reflectance of the designed

\label{Fig3}
\end{figure}
In Fig \ref{Fig3}(b) the average reflectance of structures
designed with different values of $\alpha$ and $N_{p}$ is mapped. As in the
previous case, the optimized parameters are within the zone of maximum
average reflectance. The reflectance calculation shows that this structure
has a wide quasi-omnidirectional gap that goes from 850 to 3000 nm and from
0${{}^\circ}$ to 70${{}^\circ}$ of incidence; the corresponding contour plot is 
shown in Fig. \ref{Fig3}(c) and its average reflectance between 850-3000nm is 
greater than 95\%. The measured and calculated reflectance spectra have very 
similar characteristics as shown in Fig \ref{Fig3}(d).  The synthesized PS 
multilayered 1D photonic structure has a quasi omnidirectional (from 0${{}^\circ}$ 
to 60${{}^\circ}$) band gap of approximately 1800 nm. The difference
between the calculated and measured spectra at the longer wavelengths can be
attributed to a thickness gradient along the depth, which is more pronounced in
the lower layers due to the restricted diffusivity of the electrolyte
through the structure itself \cite{Negro2003,Vincent1993} and interface roughness.

\subsection{Photonic structure with sub-mirrors stacking}

Another technique to design Bragg mirrors in a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum is by stacking sub-mirrors at different
wavelengths \cite{Xifre20,DelRio2018,Agarwal2003}. Such grouping must meet the condition 
imposed by the dispersion relation, $\cos KD=\frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\,M$, where $D$ is 
the period, which corresponds to the actual thickness of the sub-mirror, $\pm K$ 
represents a 1D Bloch's vector corresponding to a wave that propagates along 
$z$-direction \cite{Mochan1987,Mochan1988,Perez2018}, and T$\text{r}$ denotes the 
trace. This equation is bounded by the minimum and maximum values that the cosine 
function can take. Furthermore, if  the value of $\left\vert \text{Tr}\left( 
M\right) \right\vert$ is $>2$, it indicates that this frequency will not 
be able to propagate through the structure. 

The ideal stack of sub-mirrors would be that PBG of the $j$-th mirror begins 
at the edge of the PBG of the $j-1$-th mirror, until the desired interval has been covered. 
However, this arrangement does not give the maximum average reflectance due to the 
decrease in the reflectance at each intersection of the two PBGs. On the other hand, 
the number of periods of each sub-mirror is an important parameter due to its direct 
dependence on the magnitude and  width of  the photonic band gap.  As the structures 
were synthesized using porous silicon, it is essential to minimize the number of 
periods corresponding to the visible region sub-mirrors. Also, in the supplementary 
information we show the reflectance calculations for structures composed of sub 
mirrors with a constant number of periods, in these cases ODBMs are not obtained. 
For these reasons, the number of periods for each mirror was chosen as follows: for 
design wavelengths less than 500 nm ($\lambda_{D}<$500 nm), one period, for 500 
$<\lambda_{D}<$650 nm, two periods , for 650 $<\lambda_{D}<$800 nm, three, and for 
$\lambda_{D}>$ 800 nm, the number of periods was variable (Fig. \ref{Fig4}(a)). 
\begin{figure}[tbph]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
{F6OptimizedNIRSE.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{(a) Diagram showing the distribution of sub-mirrors and the corresponding 
number of periods in a PS multilayer. (b) Maximization of the average reflectance as 
a function of the overlap photonic band gap for the structures formed by sub-mirrors 
with a fixed number of periods (3 and 4), and for structures with the design of (a)

calculated reflectance of the designed structure with the optimized values for non 
polarized light. (d) Comparison of reflectance spectra calculated and measured at 
different angles of incidence. The gray band indicates the region in which the
reflectance is greater than 95$\%$. Inset shows the top view photograph of the
synthesized structure.}
\label{Fig4}
\end{figure}

Therefore, in this work the overlap percentage of the PBGs of the first and second 
mirror, second and third mirror, and so on, is also optimized. Fig \ref{Fig4}(b) 
shows the optimization results in terms of maximum average reflectance with respect 
to the PBG overlap at different sub-mirror periods, keeping them fixed (3, 4) or 
variable (1, 2  and 3) for $\lambda<500$(1 period), $500<\lambda<650$ nm (2 
periods), $650<\lambda<800$ nm (3 periods) and $\lambda>800$ (3, 6 periods). For 
example, the calculations corresponding to the reflectance spectra of the structures 
formed using sub-mirrors with constant periods (3 and 4) revealed a lower average 
reflectance as compared to the structure formed with variable periods. The 1D 
photonic structure with the highest average reflectance (named as ST-C)  is the one 
designed with variable periods and contemplates 6 periods for each sub-mirror in the 
NIR region. In the optimized structure designed for 400-3000 nm range, the photonic 
band gap overlap is around 78$\%$, thickness is 41.5 $\mu $m and the average 
reflectance is 95.3$\%$, when the  electromagnetic waves are incident from 
0${{}^\circ}$ to 89 ${{}^\circ}$. The optimized photonic structure is made up of 18 
sub-mirrors tuned to the following wavelengths 400, 460, 510, 570, 640, 720,810, 
910, 1020, 1150, 1290, 1450, 1630, 1830, 2060, 2320, 2610 and 2860 nm  with periods 
of 1 (400, 460 nm), 2(510, 570, 640 nm), 3 (720 nm) and 6 (810 nm and above).

The reflectance mapping shown in Fig \ref{Fig4}(c) reveals a quasi omnidirectional 
band gap from 950 to 2900 nm, taking into account 0${{}^\circ}$ to 60${{}^\circ}$ of 
incidence. It is also observed that at incidence angles $>$70${{}^\circ}$, for long 
wavelengths the reflectance decreases and has oscillations, which are attributed to 
the greater penetration of the electromagnetic field within the structure, as shown 
by Puente-D\'{\i}az, et al \cite{Puente2020}. Furthermore, in supplementary 
information we show the transfer matrix trace calculations as a function of the 
wavelength and the incidence angle for the ST-C photonic structure using the TE and 
TM polarization. In Fig \ref{Fig4}(d) the calculated and measured reflectance 
corresponding to the structure ST-C, at different angles of incidence is compared. 
Although, the quasi omnidirectional band gap of the synthesized structure is 
slightly less than that calculated (located from 950 to 2750 nm), the measured PBG 
is almost twice as compared to the recently reported similar structures 
(\cite{DelRio2018,Chavez2020}). 

Finally, table 2 shows some porous silicon based ODBMs designed to operate in the
NIR region and the width of the omnidirectional band gap is compared with the 
structures analyzed in the present study. The table reveals that the porous silicon 
based structures ST-B and ST-C have the widest gap width, being 1.8 times greater 
than recently reported works.

\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated the formation of highly reflective PS multilayer photonic 
structures optimized using two types of design techniques for maximal reflectance 
and minimal thickness in the NIR region. With \textit{chirped}-type Bragg mirrors, 
two regions of the electromagnetic spectrum were analyzed. The first region (350nm - 
1400 nm), optimized through an increasing function resulted in an average 
reflectance $>85\%$ with the quasi omnidirectional PBG of 360 nm centered at 1160 nm 
(980-1340 nm) for the angular range 0-60${{}^\circ}$ and more than 50$\%$ of 
reflectance from 550-980nm. The second structure was designed for 850-3000 nm 
wavelength range and the synthesized structure with optimized parameters resulted in 
the average reflectance of $~91\%$ with q-OD bandgap from 980 to 2780 nm and a 
thickness of 60.4 $\mu$m. The other design technique consisting of sub-mirrors 
stacks (designed at different wavelengths), was optimized for maximum average 
reflectance with respect to the percentage overlap of the PBG for each sub-mirror. A 
multilayer structure using the optimized parameters with sub-mirrors stack method 
was obtained with the average reflectance of $~95\%$ and a thickness of 41.5 $\mu$m. 
Furthermore, this structure revealed a 1800 nm q-OD PBG, centered at 1850 nm, in 
angular range 0-60${{}^\circ}$. Therefore, this second technique was found to be 
better due to the decreased thickness (by a factor of $~1.5$) of the framework and 
increased average reflectance. Additionally, the analysis techniques developed here 
can be used to optimize reflectance with other refractive index contrasts in PS 
multilayers or different other systems composed of other types of materials. Such 
proposed structures could be used as mirrors for solar concentrators, flat focusing reflectors,
 thermal regulators, or, if defects are included, as filters or remote chemical/biosensors 
with a wide angular independent response.
